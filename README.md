[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-qr-scanner.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-qr-scanner)

## Introduction
A [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) component for reading QR codes from the webcam. It uses the WebRTC standards for reading webcam data and [jsQR](https://github.com/cozmo/jsQR) is used for detecting QR codes in that data. To optimise the speed and experience, a web-worker is used to offload the heavy QR code algorithm on a separate process. The web worker is inlined and loaded on creation of the component.
Thanks to initial repo https://github.com/JodusNodus/react-qr-reader

## Demo
[kybarg.github.io/react-qr-scanner/](https://kybarg.github.io/react-qr-scanner/)

## Known Issues
- Due to browser implementations the camera can only be accessed over https or localhost.
- Not compatible with macOS/iOS Safari. Use `legacyMode` to support these platforms.
- In Firefox a prompt will be shown to the user asking which camera to use, so `facingMode` will not affect it.

## Install
`npm install --save react-qr-scanner`

## Example

```js
import React, { useState } from "react";
import QrReader from "react-qr-scanner";

function Example() {
  const [codeRead, setCodeRead] = useState("");

  function onScan(result) {
    console.log(`Identified: ${result}`);
    setCodeRead(result);
  }

  function onError(error) {
    console.error(error);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <QrReader
        delay={500}
        style={{
          width: 320,
          height: 240,
        }}
        onError={onError}
        onScan={onScan}
      />
      <p>{codeRead}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Example;
```

## Props

**onScan**

Type: `function`, Required, Argument: `result`

Scan event handler. Called every scan with the decoded value or `null` if no QR code was found.

**onError**

Type: `function`, Required, Argument: `error`

Function to call when an error occurs such as:
- Not supported platform
- The lack of available devices

**onLoad**

Type: `function`, Optional

Called when the component is ready for use.

**onImageLoad**

Type: `function`, Optional, Argument: React img onLoad event

Called when the image in legacyMode is loaded.

**delay**

Type: `number`, Optional, Default: `500`

The delay between scans in milliseconds. To disable the interval pass in `false`.

**facingMode**

Type: `string`, Optional

Specify which camera direction should be used (if available). Options: `front` and `rear`.

**legacyMode**

Type: `boolean`, Optional, Default: `false`.

If the device does not allow camera access (e.g. IOS Browsers, Safari) you can enable legacyMode to allow the user to take a picture (On a mobile device) or use an existing one. To trigger the image dialog just call the method `openImageDialog` from the parent component. **Warning** You must call the method from a user action (eg. click event on some element).

**maxImageSize**

Type: `number`, Optional, Default: `1500`.

If `legacyMode` is active then the image will be downscaled to the given value while keepings its aspect ratio. Allowing larger images will increase the accuracy but it will also slow down the processing time.

**style**

Type: `object`, Optional

Styling for the preview element. This will be a `video` or an `img` when `legacymode` is `true`. **Warning** The preview will keep its aspect ratio, to disable this set the CSS property [objectFit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) to `fill`.

**className**

Type: `string`, Optional

ClassName for the container element.

**chooseDeviceId**

Type: `function`, Optional, Arguments: (1) video devices matching `facingMode`, (2) all video devices

Called when choosing which device to use for scanning. By default chooses the first video device matching `facingMode`, if no devices match the first video device found is choosen.

**initialStream**

Type: `MediaStream`, Optional

Existing MediaStream to use initially.
